# Goodbye for now

After much thought and deliberation, I'm taking an indefinite break from Ethereum L1 R&D. I dedicated more than 7 years to this effort, achieved for more than I ever expected, and had an incredible time doing it.

I am humbled by the opportunity and trust afforded to me by those at the EF, the client teams and others close to core development, and the community at large. It was an unbelievable experience helping steward Ethereum into the age of proof-of-stake. I wouldn't trade it for anything.

My departure is personal and not a reflection of any facet of Ethereum, core development, or crypto at large. Being at one of the many helms that is the complex ship of Ethereum is an all-consuming experience, and although one of the greatest experiences of my life, it is one that I'm ready to relinquish, making space for other things.

I showed up many years ago as "a random person from the internet". I found the doors wide-open. I found my place and got a few things done. And, now I'm ready to take a step back and come up for air.

Ethereum R&D is in good hands. There is a profound depth of experience and leadership across the dozens of teams involved. And, although the protocol still has some work in store, the problems are solvable with a bit of time and effort.

## A few notes

I won't wax poetic with a massive post of reflections and advice, but I will say a few words to those in R&D as well as the ecosystem at large.

Work toward true value, rather than the short term gains many chase. Ethereum and the things we can build on it are deeply, intrinsically valuable for humanity. Focus your time and effort on expanding that core value, rather than chasing the numbers. This is how Ethereum will succeed, and in the long term, true value will be reflected in the numbers we can become so obsessed with.

Be careful. Ethereum's infancy is long past, and its adolescence, too, is now in the rear-view mirror. As a young adult, the world is riddled with complexity, false prophets, complex incentives, dead-ends, and other dangers. Everyone's true-north of what Ethereum should be and where it all should go is a bit different, but in aggregate, each decision that you make sums with all others to direct Ethereum through this critical time. Stay true to the good. Do your part in keeping Ethereum on the serendipitous path that has been cultivated since its genesis.

Finally, be kind. Do this during both the bull and the bear. We're generally all on the same team -- working toward Ethereum making a profound and positive impact on the world.

## What's next

I'm not entirely sure what is next in store for me. I love Ethereum, and it's likely my relationship with it is not over.

But at least through the end of the year, my priorities will be toward my family and a few small personal projects I've been putting off.

I'm not currently looking for a new full-time opportunity, but I am interested in picking up some fun part-time engagements as we enter 2025. I love the confluence of technical, people, open source, and strategy, and I have a depth of unique experience to draw upon.

Hit me up at controlshift.tech@proton.me if you want to chat or catch-up. For the time being, I only respond to emails about once a week unless we have some other agreed upon arrangement.

(Oh and my previous telegram account is dead. I will absolutely not respond there).

Wishing you all the best. I'm excited to follow along, and eager to catch-up with my many friends across the ecosystem as I pop in through the years.
