# Opening a new chapter

After time to think about where to make the most impact, I'm ready to start a new adventure. I'm headed to an organization with a big mission and a blank slate.

***I'm thrilled to announce that I'm joining as a cofounder of [Etherealize](https://www.etherealize.io/)***.

Our mission is to help onboard the world to Ethereum. I'll be at the helm of the ship alongside Vivek Raman and the incredible team he is building.

*We are at an inflection point.*

The regulatory specter has been lifted, the engines are primed, and the world is eager for new and better solutions that provide open global access, efficiency, interoperability, and composability in finance, identity, and every other aspect of our digital lives. Ethereum is the only environment that promises to do so in a truly neutral and decentralized way, and Etherealize is positioned to lead the charge.

At Etherealize, I intend to build a new *Ethereum institution* with ***Real World Ethereum*** as its north star.

This sits at the confluence of real adoption, commonsense regulation, ecosystem development, and critical R&D across L1, L2, and the application layer. We plan to become an active player across the Ethereum sphere, working to help ensure that Ethereum remains the most open, decentralized, and censorship-resistant platform the world has to offer, while simultaneously meeting the very real and very immediate needs of global adoption.

This is a hard problem with many incredible individuals and organizations already at the table. We aim to find where to augment, extend, and ultimately be most useful in the bazaar to build Ethereum together.

Where Vivek serves as a bridge from the real world into Ethereum, *I'll serve as a bridge from Ethereum back into the real world.*

I'm excited to open this new chapter and look forward to collaborating with my longtime friends, colleagues, and new faces across the ecosystem.

**Ethereum's time is now**. Let's make it happen together.
